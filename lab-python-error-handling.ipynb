    "The try-except block in Python is designed to handle exceptions and provide a fallback mechanism when code encounters errors. By enclosing the code that could potentially throw errors in a try block, followed by specific or general exception handling in the except block, we can gracefully recover from errors and continue program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there may be cases where an input may not produce an immediate error, but still needs to be addressed. In such situations, it can be useful to explicitly raise an error using the \"raise\" keyword, either to draw attention to the issue or handle it elsewhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the code to handle possible errors in Python, it is recommended to use `try-except-else-finally` blocks, incorporate the `raise` keyword where necessary, and print meaningful error messages to alert users of any issues that may occur during program execution.\n",
